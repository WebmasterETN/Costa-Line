                        Passengers registered with the INAPAM discount must present the credential issued by this institution before boarding the bus to validate the discount. If it is not presented, the difference of the full ticket cost will be charged.

If a child appears physically older than 11, age must be verified with a birth certificate or CURP; otherwise, the full fare must be paid.

                        Luggage can be checked in up to 30 minutes before the bus departure. Each passenger may carry up to 25 kilograms of free luggage (excluding cargo). Luggage includes personal items, clothing, musical instruments, wheelchairs, bicycles, strollers, toys, and tools, which must be transported in suitcases, bags, or boxes. Only hand luggage such as laptops, small bags, and backpacks that fit in the bus compartment is allowed on board. Exceeding the allowed limit incurs a charge of 1% of the base ticket fare per extra kilogram (does not apply to discounted or promotional fares).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company is not responsible for luggage without tags or for personal items carried inside the bus cabin. In case of loss or theft of checked luggage, compensation will be up to the equivalent of 20 days of the general minimum wage in Mexico City.

                    <p>
                        Passengers traveling with a pet must use a plastic or rigid transport cage (not fabric) and preferably sedate it; all pets travel in the bus luggage compartment.

                    <p>
                        The transport of exotic or endangered animals (birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish) is prohibited. If done, official SEMARNAT documents must be presented authorizing transport.

                        Unaccompanied minors under 11 years of age will not be accepted under any circumstances. Minors traveling alone must present a responsibility letter issued by their parents or guardians, releasing the company from all liability.

                        Boarding passes issued through this type of purchase do not have fiscal validity. If you require a fiscal receipt, you must generate it from our web portal <a class="__link-text" href="../.../../../">www.costaline.com.mx</a> in the "Electronic Invoicing" section located in the top right-hand menu. You will need the ticket or boarding pass operation number, seat number, and complete fiscal information.

                        Only confirmed tickets (not open tickets) can be invoiced within 30 calendar days from the travel date. Once the invoice is generated, no changes or cancellations can be made to the issued document. In cases where tickets are paid using a combination of cash and/or bank card, only the amount paid by cash and/or bank card can be invoiced.

                        If you did not receive the PDF and XML files of your fiscal receipt during the invoicing process, you can retrieve them by accessing our web portal <a class="__link-text" href="../.../../../">www.costaline.com.mx</a> in the "Electronic Invoicing" section, entering your RFC and email address. Once in the module, select "Consult History" and identify the document you wish to retrieve, either by resending it to your email, sending it to a different email address, or printing the invoice again.
